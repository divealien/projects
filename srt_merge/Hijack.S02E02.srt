1
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:15,360
Uh-huh.

2
00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:16,684
Miss?

3
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:18,102
Berger.

4
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:23,410
Um...

5
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,735
Wagon 2600 is…

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,528
Yes?

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,239
It's gone.

8
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:36,162
Zero Zero, come in…

9
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,380
Hello. Can you hear me?

10
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:46,671
This is Edward Diehl.
Manager at the Network Control Center.

11
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,424
Who are we talking to, please?

12
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:49,080
English.

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,180
Can you speak English?

14
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,600
Yes, a little English.

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:01:00,730
Um, this is Clara Berger
from the control center.

16
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:02,950
Can I talk to the driver, please?

17
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,590
You're talking to me now.

18
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:08,190
Do you understand?

19
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:11,670
Yes.

20
00:01:12,550 --> 00:01:13,750
Okay, Clara, listen to me.

21
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,550
This train has been hijacked.

22
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:19,190
Okay, there are over 200.

23
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,030
The passengers on this train,
if you do not do exactly what I say,

24
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,070
you will put them in danger.

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:26,650
Do you understand what that means?

26
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:32,930
Yes, I, I guess.

27
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,597
Who the devil is this?

28
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,800
Sorry, who am I talking to?

29
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,800
No questions,
just listen. Can you do that, Clara?

30
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:48,640
Yes, we are listening.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,520
Speak to the police. There was a man
that I want. His name is

32
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:55,600
John Bailey Brown.

33
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,720
Yeah.

34
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:03,220
Sorry, could you repeat this, please?

35
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,520
John Bailey Brown.

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:08,860
He's in Germany.

37
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,020
The government know where he is.

38
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,280
Tell them to find him.

39
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:14,060
Clara.

40
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,480
Clara.

41
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,560
Yes, I will try.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,020
No, Clara.

43
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,860
You will not try.

44
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,740
Think of the passengers.

45
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:24,460
You will do exactly what I say.

46
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:25,320
and you will do it quickly.

47
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,640
And if you do that, nobody gets out.

48
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,000
Yes?

49
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:30,920
Yes.

50
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,020
We'll contact the police.

51
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:34,580
Stay there.

52
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,960
And please don't hurt anyone.

53
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,240
I hold my head up just
enough to see the sky.

54
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,260
And when we go, we won't go slow,

55
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,720
we'll put up such a night.

56
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,900
See exactly what you are

57
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,020
Just keep your head and I kiss
your fist and touch the sky

58
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:11,960
To keep the world from dying

59
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:47,269
Hello? Can I help you?

60
00:03:47,937 --> 00:03:49,939
Wait, please. You can't go down there…

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,560
Looks like Mr. Nelson has
somewhere he'd rather be

62
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,080
What, don't forget this

63
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,140
What do you really believe
this picture shows us,

64
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:39,820
this statue?

65
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:45,140
Sam believes this image
places the fugitive

66
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,820
John Bailey Brown in Germany.

67
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,320
And I believe this could be anyone.

68
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,920
I just think it's...

69
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,480
Olivia, some advice.

70
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,280
Take heed from your predecessors
and do the

71
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,060
absolute bare minimum for this man.

72
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,780
Mr. Nelson is in a hole which
he ducked entirely for himself.

73
00:05:14,773 --> 00:05:17,651
<i>Who is this "John Bailey-Brown?"</i>

74
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,530
As far as we can tell,
he's a British criminal. A fugitive.

75
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,660
And the guy asking for him,
the hijacker, he's British too?

76
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:28,287
Yes.

77
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:31,957
Has anyone spoken to British Intelligence?

78
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,584
All agencies have been alerted.

79
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:38,005
But we need to act fast.
There has been a serious threat to life.

80
00:05:39,757 --> 00:05:43,385
More serious than my daughter's band
murdering Beethoven?

81
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:50,768
They are evacuating all the stations.
But it's rush hour.

82
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,937
Hopefully that's the worst
that happens today.

83
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,483
We make everyone late for work.

84
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,327
We're working on it.

85
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:12,748
Okay, the Chief of Police is inbound.

86
00:06:13,207 --> 00:06:15,209
Let's get our house in order
before she arrives.

87
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:17,044
Miss Berger--

88
00:06:17,544 --> 00:06:18,712
I don't understand.

89
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,426
The last signal the train went through?
Rotes Rathaus?

90
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:26,678
Yes, but then it…

91
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,681
…vanished.

92
00:06:32,101 --> 00:06:35,813
Evacuate the U5. All trains and stations.

93
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:37,355
Now.

94
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,359
The rest of you. Max, the U8. Sabine?

95
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,111
Sabine, the U7.

96
00:06:42,945 --> 00:06:43,946
And so on.

97
00:06:44,363 --> 00:06:45,697
We hold all trains,

98
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:48,367
but we don't crash the whole network.

99
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,369
We don't want mass panic.

100
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:52,450
Sarah.

101
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,083
If he contacts you again, you call me.

102
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,127
Where are you going?

103
00:06:58,377 --> 00:06:59,795
To find your disappearing train.

104
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,200
I actually don't know.

105
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:30,800
George.

106
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:32,960
Are you breathing again?

107
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,720
Rebecca's given you a drink.

108
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,060
Sir, isn't it his fault?
The train stopped.

109
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,640
Thank you, Rebecca. Very kind.

110
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:45,280
We're stumped down here, aren't we?

111
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,080
We're not. We're moving shortly.
It's been like five minutes.

112
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:48,780
It's been nine minutes.

113
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:52,520
You need to talk to them.

114
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:56,680
What? Me? No. No. No. No, no, no.

115
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,380
They're your hostages.

116
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:02,000
You're the driver. You're who
they're expected here.

117
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,000
This will all be a lot easier.

118
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,520
They're kept in the dark, okay?

119
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:12,340
Trust me.

120
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,000
Nothing on the Yovans socials.

121
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,140
Should we go ask someone?

122
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,920
I'm sure it's fine.

123
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,780
He should have updated us.

124
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,620
Or she, they.

125
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,940
So what I was thinking is,
why don't we just skip the museum and

126
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:34,860
go straight to the walking tour?

127
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:35,880
True.

128
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,480
Whatever.

129
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:38,940
Do you want your scarf back?

130
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:40,419
My scarf?

131
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,220
Mm-hmm.

132
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,640
I wanted you to keep it.

133
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,500
Thank you very much.

134
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:47,360
It's massive you.

135
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,940
Sir, what's he saying?

136
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,060
Well, that's why you should
be practicing a German.

137
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:56,820
Really?

138
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,520
Due to ongoing service problems,

139
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,760
this train is unable to
stop at all stations.

140
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,760
We're waiting there time on a red signal.

141
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,500
Currently being held at a red signal.

142
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,900
The course is.

143
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,980
We should be moving in school.

144
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:19,740
Sam, where are you?

145
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,160
Listen, I know you came all
the way from London,

146
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,240
but it took me weeks to
set this meeting up.

147
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,480
Just call me as soon as you can.

148
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,820
How did it go in Nelson?

149
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,080
He stood me up.

150
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,700
I'd have a good excuse.

151
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,220
There's delays all over the U-Bahn.

152
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,780
Terror instant of some kind.

153
00:09:49,881 --> 00:09:52,467
<i>Control, this is Wagon 2637.
What's going on?</i>

154
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:58,348
Evacuate your train. That's an order.

155
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,517
And stay off this channel.

156
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

157
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,260
this station is closed.

158
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,620
This is named to the next exit.

159
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,380
My, daren,

160
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:21,940
this baron,

161
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,760
this bar office is closed.

162
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,700
Berlin is a great.

163
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,760
All right.

164
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,520
It's very cold, well, uh,

165
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,720
Berlin is a very walkable city,

166
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,160
and we will be back up and running later.

167
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:41,808
I doubt it.

168
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:44,353
How come?

169
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:47,230
What's going on?

170
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:50,150
I'm hearing there's a driver
in serious trouble.

171
00:10:50,609 --> 00:10:51,610
On this line?

172
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,370
Okay, we're all set.

173
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,630
Let's let go in.

174
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:03,630
Okay.

175
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,610
Just what we're gonna do it's gonna.

176
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:12,770
What is it?

177
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:13,790
Fuck.

178
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:16,110
Bato.

179
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:21,090
It's the, um, the emergency brake alarm.

180
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:21,990
Someone pulled it.

181
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:23,830
We can't move until it's reset.

182
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,120
What, why did they pull the alarm?

183
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:31,420
What?

184
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,700
Because I skip stations.

185
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:35,360
Exactly.

186
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,600
Alright, your problem,
you fucking fix it.

187
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:41,680
Because if you don't get this train
moving before they find us,

188
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:42,240
then we're dead.

189
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,020
Hey.

190
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,180
Don't speak to anyone?

191
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,760
Okay. No, I'm serious,
okay? Just remember what I said

192
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:56,580
to the control center.

193
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,100
People do exactly what I
say. Nobody gets you.

194
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,020
is her. All right.

195
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,980
I speak to no one.

196
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:18,320
The most thing is the main.

197
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,120
Edward Diehl, network manager.

198
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,289
Good day.
What's happening with this train?

199
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:31,292
We have the U5 locked down and
the rest of the network is on hold.

200
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,626
Good.

201
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,712
There's only a few more stations
on the line.

202
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:36,756
There's only so far he can go, yes?

203
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,301
…yes.

204
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:43,472
You do know where the train is, Mr. Diehl?

205
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:48,477
This map is simplified.
In reality, down there it's…

206
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:51,855
a labyrinth.

207
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,030
A labyrinth.

208
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,359
Who has been speaking to him?

209
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,403
Clara Berger.

210
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,534
- Good day.
- Hello.

211
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,786
You deal with a lot of these?

212
00:13:08,163 --> 00:13:09,831
It's my second week here.

213
00:13:15,545 --> 00:13:17,380
Then let's hear what this guy has to say.

214
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:25,330
Hey, wait, are you seeing this one?

215
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:28,470
It's okay,
you didn't do anything more. It's okay.

216
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:29,950
Worry.

217
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:35,530
Do you want to bremser?

218
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:37,750
Emergency alarm?

219
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:39,450
Yeah, of course.

220
00:13:40,330 --> 00:13:42,090
Sorry about that, come on.

221
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,610
Hold on, George.

222
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,130
Shut up.

223
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,010
Sir, he just told him, shut up.

224
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:47,490
Enough.

225
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:48,790
I'm not the one that pulled the alarm.

226
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:49,670
Is George's fault?

227
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:50,470
It's enough.

228
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:51,670
Move that out of the way.

229
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:52,910
Let the driver do his job.

230
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:53,250
Now.

231
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:54,170
Yes.

232
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:59,950
Uh, I'm not going to be.

233
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,731
Hey, Driver?

234
00:14:17,649 --> 00:14:18,775
What's the hold up?

235
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:20,210
Hello?

236
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:21,970
So good mate, you just reset the alarm.

237
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:23,830
Nothing is so good mate.

238
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,490
Some of us have places to be.

239
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:26,783
Hey, Driver?

240
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,910
See, some of us have extra job.

241
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:34,270
One in 2600, this is control.

242
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:37,030
The police are here.

243
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:38,730
They're ready to talk.

244
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:40,922
Excuse me, Driver?

245
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,173
Is everything all right?

246
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:44,050
You're bleeding.

247
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,055
Sorry?

248
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:49,750
Your face?

249
00:14:50,830 --> 00:14:51,870
Zero, come in.

250
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,645
You have a cut.

251
00:14:57,390 --> 00:14:59,410
No, no. Can you me hear?

252
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,940
Need this?

253
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,980
Your cab was open.

254
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,800
Thank you.

255
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:14,121
<i>What about the driver?</i>

256
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,248
Can we talk to him?

257
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,463
Otto, are you there?

258
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,100
Zero, come in?

259
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,480
Sounds like you needed.

260
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,641
<i>Zero Zero, why aren't you answering?</i>

261
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,170
Give me a hand with me.

262
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:37,510
Just go ahead.

263
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:38,350
Yeah.

264
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,863
Wishing you a pleasant onward journey.

265
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:47,870
Sir, what is that?

266
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,490
What do you say?

267
00:15:48,810 --> 00:15:49,670
I don't know, I do.

268
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:50,970
So, what did he say?

269
00:15:54,454 --> 00:15:56,039
Zero Zero, can you hear me?

270
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:57,957
Why aren't you answering?

271
00:15:58,130 --> 00:15:58,590
Go ahead.

272
00:16:03,046 --> 00:16:04,881
- Which button do I press? This one?
- This one.

273
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,840
This is Ada Winter.

274
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,080
I'm head of the Bundespolice

275
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,700
here in Berlin.

276
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:14,740
Who am I talking to, please?

277
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:17,000
There is only one name
that is important today,

278
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:18,920
That is John Bailey Brown.

279
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,920
Where is he?

280
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,400
We will get you an answer.

281
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,040
In the meantime,
can you at least tell me

282
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:25,920
if the driver is okay?

283
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,660
Are any of the passengers injured?

284
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:31,960
I know they are fine.
Just get me what I need.

285
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,540
I give him my word. We will do
everything we can to locate him.

286
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,120
Okay, let me help you.

287
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,900
He's here, in Germany.

288
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,060
Track him down and send me proof.

289
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,120
If you could tell us who you are,
I'm sure we can find a very quick spot.

290
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:52,220
I need his exact location or people die.

291
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:12,781
What's he doing here?

292
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,500
We're driving.

293
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,060
Sir, you have to get to me in.

294
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
Thank you.

295
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:11,940
This is good,
right? It's what you wanted.

296
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:15,860
Yeah.

297
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,280
And the control center, the police,
they don't everything you ask for.

298
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:23,980
Yeah.

299
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:30,740
So why keeps threatening people?

300
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,820
You knew what was involved when
he took the money.

301
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,830
Just hope no one needs to get hurt.

302
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,200
Me too.

303
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,320
Hey? Do you send me flowers?

304
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,120
Flowers, no.

305
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:27,560
Flowers arrived.

306
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,360
Marsha Nelson, no sender.

307
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:31,520
Not me.

308
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,420
I thought about sending you flowers,
but...

309
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,040
That's not what I meant.

310
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,860
Wait, Marsha Nelson.

311
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,600
Was it Sam?

312
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:40,900
Doubt it.

313
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,160
You haven't spoken in months.

314
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,880
Well, maybe that's why you're
sending you flowers.

315
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,480
Maybe.

316
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,280
I'm thinking about you today.

317
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:55,260
I tried you earlier,
but I couldn't hear through.

318
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:56,680
No signal at the Bothy, remember?

319
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:58,920
I was sort of the point.

320
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,180
Right. And you're sure you're
okay up there?

321
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,780
I'm fine. It's really peaceful here.
It's exactly what I needed.

322
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,700
Time to reflect.

323
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,320
I'll see you tomorrow.

324
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,140
Yeah. Okay. Love you.

325
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,660
Love you.

326
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:34,170
Mr Faber.

327
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:38,350
I got here as quickly as I could.

328
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:40,050
You almost beat me.

329
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,070
Look, there's clearly a UK angle here,
but it's your jurisdiction.

330
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:52,770
And as I said to your boss,
if there's any information I can share,

331
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,330
any insight I can provide,

332
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,190
well, then I'll be right here.

333
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:25,243
Wait. I'll take that.

334
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,290
Detective Beck.

335
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,382
In the toilet?

336
00:21:40,383 --> 00:21:41,384
Yes.

337
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,468
HELLO,
MR. NELSON

338
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,060
John Bailey Brown hasn't been seen
since the Kingdom Airlines thing.

339
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:30,900
So he is missing?

340
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,420
Yes.

341
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:34,820
Might be surprised if he
ended up in Germany.

342
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,400
This hijacker of yours seems to disagree.

343
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,780
He's not my hijacker.

344
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:40,720
Oh, he's British though.

345
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,180
Yes, I'm afraid that doesn't
really narrow it down.

346
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:47,140
The good news is that
everyone leaves a trail.

347
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:51,220
So whoever this man is,
eventually we'll identify him.

348
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,360
But right now we're nowhere.

349
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,200
Much like your train.

350
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,060
Actually, maybe not.

351
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,253
He's heading on to the U8.

352
00:22:59,962 --> 00:23:01,756
The U8? How is that possible?

353
00:23:03,091 --> 00:23:04,717
Miss Berger will explain.

354
00:23:10,650 --> 00:23:11,910
at Alexanderplatz?

355
00:23:12,350 --> 00:23:13,810
You can't change here.

356
00:23:14,170 --> 00:23:14,870
Yes, you can.

357
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:18,970
If you're a passenger, yes,
but not if you're a train.

358
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,360
It's an old maintenance tunnel.
It was flooded 20 years ago,

359
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,180
so they closed it.

360
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,360
The old points are just beyond Rottes
Rathouse. Exactly where the

361
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:33,980
train disappeared.

362
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:35,980
He's here.

363
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,400
So he's making his own route.
Where will he go next?

364
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,880
We need to evacuate the whole network.

365
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,420
Already on it. We're just moving the last
few trains out of his path.

366
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:48,700
Good.

367
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:53,060
Sorry, this isn't my specific
area of expertise,

368
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:56,720
but did you say move the
trains out of his path?

369
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:20,990
Thank you.

370
00:24:21,669 --> 00:24:23,628
Excuse me, you're the last ones…

371
00:24:23,629 --> 00:24:24,589
…you need to leave, please.

372
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,490
Thank you.

373
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:28,630
All right.

374
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,722
That's it. That's all of them. Thanks.

375
00:24:32,730 --> 00:24:33,410
Thank you.

376
00:24:33,931 --> 00:24:35,849
<i>All station managers be advised.</i>

377
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,312
<i>Please report to Alexanderplatz
to assist with evacuation.</i>

378
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,939
Copy that, Control. I can attend.
The U5, yes?

379
00:24:42,899 --> 00:24:44,692
<i>No. U8.</i>

380
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:45,630
R.

381
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:06,780
Rang.

382
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,820
The thing on the U.

383
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,180
Yeah, we'll brief

384
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:10,860
political section

385
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:11,280
when we can.

386
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:12,860
Right, just quickly, are there any U.K.

387
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:13,980
citizens caught up in it?

388
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:15,140
Come on, you know the drug.

389
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:17,140
There must be some connection or
all you suits from

390
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,700
SIS want to be crammed in there together.

391
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,700
Okay, let's just say there are
no British victims being reported.

392
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:34,230
Okay everyone, let's get started.

393
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,251
Okay, Clara.

394
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,211
Stick to the script.

395
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,755
We can hear everything
between you and the train…

396
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:49,590
…and we'll step in if you need us.

397
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:51,300
Understood?

398
00:25:53,302 --> 00:25:54,678
Understood.

399
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,513
Good.

400
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,740
It's a huge risk to
provoke him like this.

401
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,620
The mobile situation is even risk here.

402
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,380
This will give us control.

403
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,860
This will give us time.

404
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:12,000
There he is.

405
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:17,118
Good job.

406
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,100
What are you doing?

407
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:46,720
Seriously.

408
00:26:56,010 --> 00:26:57,750
Clara, I thought we had an understanding.

409
00:26:59,830 --> 00:27:00,490
We do?

410
00:27:02,850 --> 00:27:04,190
What the hell are you doing?

411
00:27:05,770 --> 00:27:07,850
The train in front of you is broken down.

412
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,490
We are trying to move it.

413
00:27:11,830 --> 00:27:14,890
Let me figure out how long
the engineering team will take.

414
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:29,065
GSG9 can be on site in 15 minutes.

415
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,760
We send armed units down there blind.

416
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,660
We are risking passengers' lives.

417
00:27:45,110 --> 00:27:47,610
Okay. Get GSD 9 on site.

418
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,510
but they do not engage until I say so.

419
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:53,050
Mr. Faber, 15 minutes.

420
00:27:53,470 --> 00:27:56,230
That's how long you have to get
me something solid on the sky.

421
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,348
Yes, okay. Copy that.

422
00:28:03,599 --> 00:28:04,767
Let's go.

423
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,500
We're ready.

424
00:28:11,148 --> 00:28:12,483
To Alexanderplatz.

425
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,800
And what are we telling them?

426
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,370
And what are we telling them?

427
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:31,450
Well, are we telling them the same
lies that we're being told?

428
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:34,830
Go on.

429
00:28:35,110 --> 00:28:40,420
Uh-huh.

430
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:41,260
Oh.

431
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,000
Yes.

432
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:46,640
The reason for us...

433
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,060
...the reason for is a other...

434
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,420
...train blocking the line like that.

435
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,120
How much of this bull should do
they expect us to swallow?

436
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,500
It's then here also for us.

437
00:28:55,660 --> 00:28:55,700
...for us further.

438
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:57,780
...their nature rebuild.

439
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,350
What is that?

440
00:29:05,990 --> 00:29:06,730
What you mean?

441
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:08,750
That, there, that doorway.

442
00:29:09,090 --> 00:29:10,610
It's nothing, it's a...

443
00:29:11,270 --> 00:29:14,930
Shaltraum, the room for all these
witches and so on.

444
00:29:16,910 --> 00:29:17,730
And the cameras?

445
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:18,330
Yeah.

446
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:22,250
But it leads into the station and
end up to the street.

447
00:29:22,770 --> 00:29:23,810
So we could go through...

448
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:26,230
No, we're not going anywhere, Otto.

449
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:32,660
Have you got a portable radio?

450
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:38,420
Okay.

451
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,640
Can you keep an eye on my bike?

452
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,120
Gonna speak to the driver.

453
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,040
What? Why?

454
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:48,760
Because someone's not telling the truth.

455
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:20,950
This is the whole station from here.

456
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,724
Hello, Driver?

457
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,280
Look, you are right.

458
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:57,280
There's no one there.

459
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:00,660
You want this?

460
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:05,540
Clarie lied to me about the train.

461
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,380
No. Engineers are on site.

462
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,080
But it's going to take another
10 minutes or so.

463
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,780
Look, there are no engineers, are there?

464
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:22,460
Hmm? You broke our deal.

465
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:24,840
Pull Winter on.

466
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,400
This is Winter.

467
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:33,580
I know what you're doing.

468
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,420
You're gonna get people killed.

469
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:39,400
We are doing everything we can
to move the train.

470
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,880
Stop lying to me.

471
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,580
Please talk to us.

472
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,620
We want to help you here.

473
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,420
Let the passengers go.

474
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,880
Not till I get what I want.

475
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,440
We are looking into it.

476
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:56,080
Why would I listen to you when
you're not being honest with me?

477
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,320
Move that train.

478
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,960
So much for buying us time.

479
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,380
We can still end this.

480
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,300
You don't have any updates for me,
do you?

481
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,620
Like I said,
it's your jurisdiction. I'm just

482
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:15,520
here to support.

483
00:32:19,563 --> 00:32:21,982
<i>Hello? Why are you lying to us?</i>

484
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:24,430
Hey!

485
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:31,280
Hello?

486
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:33,661
Why have we stopped again?

487
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:36,955
I've already announced that.

488
00:32:40,876 --> 00:32:42,294
Please go back to your seat.

489
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:46,090
Wasn't that British guy
going to patch you up?

490
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,180
This is Polizai President and Winter.

491
00:32:51,820 --> 00:32:53,980
You're right. We're keeping you
in the tunnel.

492
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:57,620
We're working on your demands,
but we cannot jeopardize the

493
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:59,020
safety of your hostages.

494
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,100
Hostages?

495
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,840
Back, check this one out.

496
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:12,180
You're so dude.

497
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:13,200
Seriously.

498
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:14,900
You just released one.

499
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,740
My taste is proper vintage.

500
00:33:18,060 --> 00:33:19,140
Like early M&M.

501
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,900
You're a smart man.

502
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,440
Okay, don't make this any more difficult
than it needs to be.

503
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,020
Don't fuck with me.

504
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:33,990
Don't.

505
00:33:33,990 --> 00:33:36,210
Hey, there's this getting out of hand.

506
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:38,890
Is those men you're asking for
a word or is it?

507
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:39,850
Yes, he is.

508
00:33:40,670 --> 00:33:47,070
Okay, we're in a stale mate here, Winter.

509
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:48,490
Keeping me here?

510
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:50,370
This is not good.

511
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:54,150
I just want to keep everyone safe.

512
00:33:54,650 --> 00:33:55,470
We'll shift that train.

513
00:33:56,490 --> 00:34:00,950
I told you I can't put
any more people in danger.

514
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:04,210
That's exactly what you have done.

515
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:09,290
And when people start dying,
it will be your fault.

516
00:34:10,409 --> 00:35:00,560
Two minutes from Alex.

517
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,853
We're two minutes out from Alexanderplatz.

518
00:35:05,354 --> 00:35:06,355
Get ready.

519
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,160
We have a different priority now if
we stay here. We're dead.

520
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:12,800
Take this off. Take your belt off.

521
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,460
What are we doing?

522
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:40,520
I don't understand.

523
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:40,960
Hold it.

524
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,300
Why? What's in it?

525
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:45,540
What's in it?

526
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:49,320
This is madness. What are you
going to do with him?

527
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:50,760
Walter?

528
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,420
Do you play your part? I'll play my.

529
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:54,760
Okay?

530
00:36:00,850 --> 00:36:01,730
No sudden moves.

531
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:08,630
Why? What's in there? What are you doing?

532
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:12,350
Okay, Winter,
I'm gonna send the passenger

533
00:36:12,350 --> 00:36:13,690
down to the next platform.

534
00:36:15,930 --> 00:36:16,970
Here's a briefcase with him.

535
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:22,030
Okay. What's in the briefcase?

536
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:30,970
If you do not shift that
train by 11 a.m.,

537
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:31,730
you will find out.

538
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:39,220
So now he's threatening to
blow up innocent civilians.

539
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:40,920
It's time to take him out.

540
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,940
I didn't want to escalate this.

541
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:44,560
You'll forgive me.

542
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,140
A particular train has left the station.

543
00:36:59,040 --> 00:36:59,460
A fire,

544
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,200
a steady,

545
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:04,060
stand on a front of a stand of a place.

546
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,100
Go!

547
00:37:09,311 --> 00:37:10,854
We've arrived at Alexanderplatz.

548
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,420
Security incident.

549
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:22,520
What did you say?

550
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,080
My mate just texted,
he just said he can't get on the U-band

551
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:29,220
because there's been some sort
of security incident.

552
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:33,340
He hasn't said anything else,
so I don't actually have anything

553
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,280
more to give you guys.

554
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:36,880
Okay.

555
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:39,860
You're all gonna head down
to the platform.

556
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,360
You're gonna hold this out
where it can be

557
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,320
seen by as many cameras as possible.

558
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,140
We'll be here watching you.

559
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,600
Can you do that, Freddy?

560
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,320
Hmm?

561
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,180
Do I have a choice?

562
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:57,280
Yeah.

563
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,260
If you stay here and risk
the lives of 200,

564
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,420
or you can go down there

565
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,960
and risk only your room.

566
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,940
What if I don't give you what you want?

567
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:49,160
I just have to make sure we're ready.

568
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,600
I understand you have
some important information.

569
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,020
Yes.

570
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:11,780
Right. Yes. Um,
I think I know someone on the train.

571
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:12,900
A UK citizen.

572
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,000
Friends and family has
really something for

573
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,080
the embassy to be dealing with.

574
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,220
I'm from the embassy.

575
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:21,860
Okay, well, right now,
I'm busy with the

576
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,140
British intelligence response.

577
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,660
So you already know then?

578
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,040
Who the hijacker is?

579
00:39:57,104 --> 00:39:59,689
There's the passenger,
he has the briefcase.

580
00:40:02,850 --> 00:40:05,830
You're going to kill an innocent man.

581
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:09,970
No, you are.

582
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,930
Move the train.

583
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,710
Ladies and gentlemen,

584
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,726
So we just let this guy go up in smoke?

585
00:40:38,728 --> 00:40:42,566
Maybe we should just move the train.

586
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,318
A strike is our only option.

587
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,078
Send them in.

588
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,650
You can't the civilist in.

589
00:40:58,530 --> 00:40:59,550
I'm sorry.

590
00:41:02,586 --> 00:41:03,587
<i>Engage.</i>

591
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,255
Understood.

592
00:41:30,405 --> 00:41:31,990
We've got eyes on the passenger.

593
00:41:32,282 --> 00:41:33,825
No sign of the target.

594
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:38,280
If you're men take one more step into
the station and is game over.

595
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,373
How is he seeing this?

596
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:41,840
Do you copy?

597
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,085
Fall back.

598
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,420
Back.

599
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,007
Excuse me?

600
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,052
We are evacuating this station.

601
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:54,094
Stop.

602
00:41:54,095 --> 00:41:55,096
Hold position.

603
00:41:57,432 --> 00:41:59,434
Did you hear what I just said?

604
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,140
Who's this now?

605
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:02,940
Winter?

606
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:04,813
Well, who is that?

607
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:06,106
That's one of our station managers.

608
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:07,442
I thought we had it locked down!

609
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:18,710
Oh, you're put in people's lives at
risk. Get her out of there.

610
00:42:21,750 --> 00:42:22,610
We are working on it.

611
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,501
Help me.

612
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,836
Get this off me.

613
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:30,048
Why? What's in there?

614
00:42:30,924 --> 00:42:33,425
Don't move. He has a bomb!

615
00:42:33,426 --> 00:42:34,427
What?

616
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:39,182
Cover him. I'll go for her.

617
00:42:44,370 --> 00:42:45,290
What's it to be?

618
00:42:45,590 --> 00:42:45,830
Wait, sir.

619
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:57,780
Zero, zero.

620
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,800
You know my name, but I don't know yours.

621
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,140
Don't try to negotiate with me.

622
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:08,060
It's Sam.

623
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:10,180
His name is Sam Nelson.

624
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,320
That's he you're talking to.

625
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,640
Please.

626
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,517
Help me.

627
00:43:22,726 --> 00:43:23,768
Don't move!

628
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:27,772
Come here.

629
00:43:29,357 --> 00:43:30,275
Come to me.

630
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:34,170
Please don't do this.

631
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:35,790
Sam.

632
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:37,590
What the fuck?

633
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:39,990
It's Sam, isn't it?

634
00:43:42,290 --> 00:43:43,610
Are you there?

635
00:43:43,610 --> 00:43:44,710
Sam, are you there?

636
00:43:46,810 --> 00:43:50,810
Sam, please, we know who you are
and we can figure this out.

637
00:43:55,091 --> 00:43:56,301
Come, come, come. Let's move.

638
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:58,470
Don't go.

639
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,598
Don't go.

640
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,142
Everyone with me. Pull back.

641
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,540
Are you there?

642
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,140
Sam, please, are you there?

643
00:44:12,140 --> 00:44:12,380
Sam, please, are you there?

644
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:13,000
Sam.

645
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,640
Forty-five seconds.

646
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,831
Help!

647
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:33,254
Help!

648
00:44:35,120 --> 00:44:39,080
30 seconds.

649
00:44:40,160 --> 00:45:04,590
I didn't want to do this.

650
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:06,890
What?

651
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:09,707
TECHNICAL FAULT

652
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,420
Take you home with me.

653
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,460
Put your...

654
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:38,040
I don't know.
