● Great question! Here's a practical breakdown of your options and what's
  involved:

  Option 1: Kivy/KivyMD (Python → Android)

  Best fit for your skills
  - Write the app in Python using Kivy (UI framework) + KivyMD (Material Design
  widgets)
  - Package for Android using Buildozer (runs on WSL/Linux)
  - Dropbox integration via the dropbox Python SDK
  - Pros: Stay in Python, relatively quick to prototype
  - Cons: Larger APK size (~30MB+), slightly non-native feel, Kivy ecosystem is
  smaller

  Option 2: Kotlin/Jetpack Compose (Native Android)

  Industry standard
  - Use Android Studio (runs on Windows, ~8GB RAM recommended)
  - Write in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose (modern declarative UI)
  - Dropbox SDK available for Android/Java
  - Pros: Native performance, best Android integration (notifications, alarms,
  background tasks)
  - Cons: Steeper learning curve coming from Python

  Option 3: Flutter (Cross-platform)

  Good middle ground
  - Uses Dart (similar to Python/JS in feel)
  - Rich widget library, great tooling
  - Dropbox via REST API or community packages
  - Pros: Fast development, polished UI, could target iOS too
  - Cons: New language (Dart), another ecosystem to learn

  └─────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
  The Tricky Parts

  - Reliable notifications — Android aggressively kills background processes;
  you need AlarmManager or WorkManager to make reminders fire reliably
  - Dropbox OAuth — Requires registering an app on the Dropbox developer
  console, handling the auth flow
  - Testing — Android Studio includes an emulator; for Kivy you'd use Buildozer
  + a physical device or emulator

  My Recommendation

  Given your Python background and that this is personal-use:

  1. Quickest path: Kivy/KivyMD via WSL with Buildozer. You stay in Python, and
  for a personal reminder app it's perfectly adequate.
  2. Best long-term investment: Kotlin + Android Studio. More to learn upfront,
  but the notification/alarm system works natively and reliably.

  Want to dig into any of these options? If you share more about what your
  reminder app should do (recurring reminders? categories? what kind of Dropbox
  backup — JSON file, database sync?), I can help you plan the architecture and
  get started.

> I want to build a personal android app for reminders (I'll add details of 
   what I want), linked to dropbox for backup/sharing - what's involved?    
  I'm on windows now, but have wsl too, and am proficient with python, but  
  not done any android dev                                                  

● Here's a practical breakdown for someone in your position:

  Your Best Options

  1. Kivy + Buildozer (Python → Android) — Fastest for you

  - Write everything in Python using Kivy (UI) + KivyMD (Material Design look)
  - Package into an APK using Buildozer (runs in WSL)
  - Dropbox via the dropbox Python SDK
  - Pros: You already know the language, quick to prototype
  - Cons: Bigger APK (~30MB+), slightly non-native feel, notification/alarm
  reliability can be fiddly

  2. Kotlin + Android Studio — Best result

  - Android Studio runs on Windows (needs ~8GB RAM)
  - Kotlin is readable and not a huge leap
  - Native access to alarms, notifications, background tasks
  - Pros: Reliable reminders, native feel, huge ecosystem
  - Cons: Steepest learning curve

  3. Flutter (Dart) — Good middle ground

  - Dart feels similar to Python/JS
  - Polished UI toolkit, good tooling
  - Pros: Fast dev cycle, could target iOS too someday
  - Cons: New language + framework to learn

  What You'll Need to Build
  Piece: Reminder storage
  Notes: Local SQLite database
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Piece: Timed notifications
  Notes: The hardest part — Android kills background apps aggressively. Needs
    AlarmManager/WorkManager (native) or workarounds (Kivy)
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Piece: UI
  Notes: List of reminders, add/edit screen, settings
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Piece: Dropbox sync
  Notes: Register app at dropbox.com/developers, OAuth2 login flow,
    upload/download a JSON or DB file
  ────────────────────────────────────────
  Piece: Dev/test
  Notes: Android Studio emulator (any option) or your physical phone via USB
  The Honest Tricky Bits

  - Reliable alarms/notifications — This is the #1 pain point for reminder apps.
   Native Android (Kotlin) handles this best. Kivy can do it but requires more
  plumbing via pyjnius to call Android APIs
  - Dropbox OAuth — Not hard, but involves a web-based login redirect flow
  - Build pipeline — Buildozer (for Kivy) can be finicky on first setup in WSL;
  Android Studio "just works" on Windows

  My Take

  For a personal reminder app, I'd suggest picking based on this:

  - Want it working this weekend? → Kivy/Python, accept some rough edges on
  notifications
  - Want it solid and a learning investment? → Kotlin + Android Studio. A simple
   reminder app is actually a great first Android project

  ---
  What does your reminder app need to do specifically? Things like:
  - One-off vs recurring reminders?
  - Categories/tags?
  - What should the Dropbox backup look like — full sync, manual export, shared
  file another device reads?
  - Any other features?

  That'll help me sketch out the architecture and get you started on whichever
  path you pick.
